# What is this

This is a fork of https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes intended for our personal use. 
We made this fork to use a modified version of the repository's workflows, specifically the very convenient Godot build pipeline. 

We've edited the Godot build workflows to include the following additional modules:
- [GodotErrorHandler](https://github.com/binogure-studio/godot-error-handler/tree/master) which we use for our error reporting logic

The workflow was also trimmed down to build only the version of Godot we need.
